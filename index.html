                  <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
                  I want to inform you that whenever you
                  use the app, in a case of an error in the app
                  the developer uses the collected data of the third-party
                  services to improve the app functions. This log data may
                  include information such as your device name, OS version,
                  the device configurations when using the app and other 
                  statistics.

                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  Beia Master does not use and will never collect cookies. However,
                  this app may use or support third-party services that uses and collects
                  cookies. This include app's support for external web content with the use of chrome 
                  custom tabs or by device default browser but does not provide traffic
                  source. These supported browsers or device default browser may collect
                  or have different settings in collecting cookies.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  Beia Master value your trust in providing your
                  information used for third-party services, 
                  thus Beia Master will only associate and use trusted 
                  third party services to ensure security and reliability
                  on how your information are used and collected.

                  Beia Master may contain links to other sites and is not operated 
                  by itself. If you proceed, beia master does not share traffic source
                  and will use third party integration to open the link or with your
                  device default browser. Therefore, Beia Master strongly advises you
                  to review the privacy policies, or practices of these third-party sites, services
                  or browsers used to open the link.
                </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
                  Beia Master does not directly collect any form of 
                  user data. In the case of children under 13 using the app
                  and third-party services collected personally identifiable information,
                  the app may refer you to the third-party services privay policy on how
                  they process personal information of children under 13.
                  If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child's
                  personal information were collected, please contact the developer so 
                  that he can assist you on how to review these third-party services
                  privacy policy.

                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I may not be able to notify you to the changes,
                  as the app does not hold any of your contact details.
